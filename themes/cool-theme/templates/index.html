    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="{{ STATIC }}/images/prof_pic.jpg" alt="Me" style="float:right; margin-left:20px;width: 200px;height: auto;">
    <p> I'm a PhD candidate at UNSW Canberra, graduating in March 2025. To the right, you can see me and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheomseongdae">Cheomseongdae</a> (첨성대 is the oldest surviving astronomical observatory in Asia, located in Gyeongju/South Korea) in the background.</p>
    <p> I started my BSc in Astronomy on 2016 at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) and graduated around mid 2020 by presenting my thesis titled <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/509/2/2885/6424945">Period-change rates in Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids revisited</a> with Prof. Marcio Catelan as my advisor. Then, in 2021 I joined UNSW Canberra for a PhD in Physics under the supervision of Dr. Ashley Ruiter, with whom I am working on binary systems involving both white dwarf and sub-dwarf B stars by using the rapid binary population synthesis code <a href="https://compas.science/index.html">COMPAS</a>. My PhD thesis is related to the formation, evolution and characteristics of sub-dwarf B stars.</p>
    <p> I'm generally interested in Stellar Astrophysics, whether it is stellar structure and evolution, variability, modelling or any star-related things you might think-of. Other than that, I also have additional experience in different topics. This includes a short summer-research at PUC under Prof. Franz Bauer (AGN-related) and a summer internship at ESO Chile under Dr. Claudia Paladini (Interferometry by using the MATISSE instrument). You can find more details in my <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/cv">CV</a>.</p>
    <p> On my free time I play videogames casually (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect#Setting">Mass Effect</a> is one of the reasons why I got into astronomy), read <a href="https://comic.naver.com/index">webcomics</a> and practice/learn the Korean language (제 웹사이트 방문하셔서 감사합니다 ㅎㅎ).</p>
